Maritime domain awareness (MDA) is [defined](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritime_domain_awareness) as the effective understanding of anything associated with the maritime domain that could impact the security, safety, economy, or environment.  The maritime domain is defined as all areas and things of, on, under, relating to, adjacent to, or bordering on a sea, ocean, or other navigable waterway, including all maritime-related activities, infrastructure, people, cargo, and vessels and other conveyances.

The International Collaborative Development of Open Source Tools for Enhanced Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) is a program aimed at developing enhanced global maritime domain awareness via two components:

  1. A global community of open source algorithm and tool developers.
  1. A web-portal which allows users from all nations to visualize and share data, share analysis, and communicate to achieve enhanced MDA.
